    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>My Skills</h3>

    <p>Hello! This is my first attempt at creating a webpage. I'm excited to learn more about HTML!</p>
    <p>I enjoy coding, playing football, and reading books during my free time.</p>
    <p>Learning HTML is fun because I can see instant results in my browser.</p>
    <p>I hope to become a full-stack developer one day and build amazing projects.</p>
